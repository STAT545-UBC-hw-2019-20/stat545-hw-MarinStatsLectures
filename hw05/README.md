# Assignment #5 Repository 

This folder contains [Assignment #5](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/hw05/hw05/) work.

The focus of the assignment was to import/export data, to write a figure to file, and to make use of functions such as *fct_infreq()* , *fct_relevel()*, and so on.

Work was written up in _RMarkdown_, and knitted to an HTML file.
