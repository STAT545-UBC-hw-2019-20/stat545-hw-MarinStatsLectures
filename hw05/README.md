# Assignment #5 Repository 

This folder contains __Assignment #5__ work.

The focus of the assignment was to import/export data, to write a figure to file, and to make use of functions such as *fct_infreq()* , *fct_relevel()*, and so on.

Work was written up in _RMarkdown_, and knitted to an HTML file.

You can [view the HTML file here](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-MarinStatsLectures/hw04/hw05_import_data_and_more.html)
