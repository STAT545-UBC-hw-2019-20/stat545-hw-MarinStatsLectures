# My Homework Repo

This is where my _homework_ will be stored.  

## Repo Orientation

This is currently a _work in progress_, and the location of files, etc, may shift around a bit.  Each assigbnment will be contained in a different folder.  Here you can find the [Homework 1 Files.](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/stat545-hw-MarinStatsLectures/tree/master/hw01)   

Aside from homework, you can find some [useful links here](https://github.com/MarinStatsLectures/STAT545-participation/blob/master/navigating_github.md).

## Who am I?

My name is _**Mike Marin**_ and I am a Senior Instructor at The University of British Columbia, in [The School of Population and Public Health](www.spph.ubc.ca).  I love statistics, I love teaching, and I love randomness and games of chance.  

>My love for statistics came out of my love for solving puzzles, playing games of chance (casino games, board games, etc).  

I am taking STAT 545 to update my knowledge on R, mainly use of the __tidyverse__ .  When I was trained, RStudio didn't even exist!  I want to be able to pass on to my own students more modern ways of working in R, as I mainly code using base-R, although I don't want to be a dinosaur who says stuck in his old ways!

I also have a [YouTube channel](www.youtube.com/marinstatlectures) introducing the use of R, which I have used for my statistics courses. They start at the very beginning, and assume very little knowledge of coding.  The channel also contains more advanced videos, as well as videos introducing statistics concepts at an introductory/indermediate level.

One piece of adivce I will give for work/career (and this is partly to make use of a numbered list):

- Find something you like/love to do
- Find out what you are good at
- Find out what you can get paid for

If you can find something that covers all 3 of these simultaneously, you will have a great work-life!
